    "The main goal of this scenario is to predict the future value of a customer. For marketing groups, the customer lifetime value (CLTV) is an important metric to understand the revenues attached to the future relationship with the customer. The CLTV is one of the metrics that is used to optimize the marketing spend to generate maximum returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario we will be using an online retain sales data to predict the future spend in a given time range for an existing customer with known transaction history. In order to develop the predictive model, we will generate features such as recency, frequency, and monetary from the transaction history that capture the buying profile of customers and thus will help in making accurate predictions on future spend."

    "For this scenario, we will leverage [Automated Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-auto-train) with [Azure Machine Learning service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml). For a given type of problem, for example **Regression**, the automated machine learning provides an automated way to evaluate different algorithms and hyperparameters so that you can get the best trained model for your problem with minimum effort. In this notebook we will learn how Automated Machine Learning can be applied to create and train a regression model to make predictions of customer future spend based on their prior transaction history.\n",
