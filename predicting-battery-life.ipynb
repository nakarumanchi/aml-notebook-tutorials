    "In this scenario, we would like to predict the likelihood of battery failure based on the telemetry stream of time series data that the car provides about how the battery performs when the car is started, how it is charging while running and how well it is holding its charge, among other factors. If they detect a battery failure is imminent within the next 30 days, we would like to send an alert."

    "For this scenario, we will leverage [Automated Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-auto-train) with [Azure Machine Learning service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml). For a given type of problem, for example **Time Series Forecasting**, the automated machine learning provides an automated way to evaluate different algorithms and hyperparameters so that you can get the best trained model for your problem with minimum effort. In this notebook we will learn how Automated Machine Learning can be applied to create and train a forcast model that predicts battery failure from time-series data.\n",
